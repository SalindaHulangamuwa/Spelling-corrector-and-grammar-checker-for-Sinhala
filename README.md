# Spelling-corrector-and-grammar-checker-for-Sinhala

This project aims to develop a Sinhala spell and grammar checker that detects and corrects spelling and 
grammatical errors in Sinhala text. It includes a spell checker for automatic error correction and a 
grammar checker to identify and fix contextual grammatical issues. Three AI approaches such as Rule
based, LLM-based, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Fine-tuned LLM(XLM-RoBERTa) models 
were evaluated for grammar correction. The most effective approach was selected and tested on five 
paragraphs to measure its accuracy in spelling corrections and grammar suggestions.
